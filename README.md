# Asthma-Predicition-Using-Machine-Learning


In this section, we discuss the proposed method for predicting asthma risk.Data and deep learning networks for model training are discussed.A block diagram of the proposed system is shown.Weather data and indoor air pollution, characterized by PM2.5 and PM10 data, were the input to the deep learning model, and peak expiratory flow (PEFR) provided the labels used when training the model.We discussed the tools and steps involved in IoT implementation.This section describes real-time data collection, data usage, and smartphone applications.
